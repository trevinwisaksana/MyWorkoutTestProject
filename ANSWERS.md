1. Total time spent: 8 hours
2. How challenging did you find the task: [ ] Easy [ ✅] Medium [ ] Hard
3. What were the most challenging parts:
    • Moving the text field above the keyboard
    • Creating a mini database that can detect if the email user has already been registered
4. Any additional comments about the task/implementation:
    • The codebase was written using Xcode 12, please run it using the same version
    • There seems to be a bug with the simulator in the Sign Up screen. The password text field doesn't deploy the keyboard. But it works fine using a real device.
    • I could have spent 6 hours making this if I did not get stuck with the password text field bug
        • This bug only shows when the text field's isSecuredEntry variable is set to true
    • I avoided using third-party dependencies as it may be an overkill
    • I made a mistake deleting a branch after I merged it. This was done when I was working on the welcome screen
5. If you had more time to complete the test, are there any specific changes/refactoring that you would have liked to do: 
    • Implement unit tests and loading indicator in the profile data
